      <h2 id="model">Data model</h2>
      <p>
        Each player has a small JSON profile (identity, first/last seen, session totals, all-time
        metric counters, period baselines, custom metrics and milestones). Time-series data is
        stored separately as append-only JSON Lines. Nothing is written per Minecraft event.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="text"
        filename="plugins/statfyr/data/"
        code={`server.json                  # peaks, unique players per day, session counts, milestones

      />

      <h2 id="sessions">Sessions</h2>
      <p>
        Join/leave sessions survive restarts. StatFYR tracks first seen, last seen, join/leave
        timestamps, session duration, total sessions, average and longest session, total playtime,
        active playtime and AFK time.

      />

      <h2 id="history">History & storage</h2>
      <p>
        Online players are snapshotted on a configurable interval (default 5 minutes). Snapshots are
        appended to <code>history/players/&lt;uuid&gt;.jsonl</code> and queried by streaming the file
        and filtering by time range — the full dataset is never loaded into memory.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="yaml"
        code={`collection:
  enabled: true
  snapshot-interval-seconds: 300

  enabled: true

      />
      <Callout kind="note">
        Old snapshots are pruned automatically according to <code>retention-days</code>. Use{" "}
        <code>/statfyr purge-history</code> to clear history on demand.
      </Callout>

      <h2 id="periods">Periods & archives</h2>
      <p>
        Leaderboards support <code>daily</code>, <code>weekly</code>, <code>monthly</code> and{" "}
        <code>all_time</code>. Period values are computed as the delta between a player's current
        totals and a baseline captured at the start of the window.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a window rolls over, StatFYR archives the finished leaderboards before resetting the
        baselines, so historical standings remain available at{" "}
        <code>/api/archive/&lt;metric&gt;</code>.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock

      />

      <h2 id="server">Server analytics</h2>
      <p>
        <code>/api/server/summary</code> aggregates current online, peak today/week/month/all-time,
        average concurrency, unique players, total playtime, average session, sessions per day, and
        new vs returning players.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="json"

  "unique_players_month": 812,
  "total_players": 4218,
  "average_session": 38
}`}
      />

      <h2 id="retention">Retention</h2>
      <p>
        D1/D7/D14/D30 retention is computed from first-seen cohorts and the per-day distinct player
        sets, without expensive scans. Exposed at <code>/api/server/retention</code>.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="json"
        code={`{
  "d1": 0.61,
  "d7": 0.38,
  "d14": 0.27,
  "d30": 0.19
}`}
      />

      <h2 id="segments">Segmentation</h2>
      <p>
        Players are classified into <code>new</code>, <code>active</code>,{" "}
        <code>highly_active</code>, <code>at_risk</code>, <code>inactive</code> and{" "}
        <code>churned</code> based on recency and session count. Exposed at{" "}
        <code>/api/server/segments</code> and per-player via{" "}
        <code>/api/player/&#123;player&#125;/retention</code>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="afk">AFK & active time</h2>
      <p>
        Optional AFK detection splits playtime into active and AFK time. The inactivity threshold is
        configurable, and movement/commands mark a player active. StatFYR does not interfere with
        other AFK plugins.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="yaml"
        code={`collection:
  afk:
    enabled: true
    threshold-seconds: 300`}
      />

      <h2 id="heatmaps">Heatmaps</h2>
      <p>
        <code>/api/server/activity</code> returns sessions by hour, sessions by weekday, peak by
        day, sessions by day and new players by day — enough to build activity heatmaps externally.
      </p>

      <h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Disable collection entirely with <code>collection.enabled: false</code>.</li>
        <li>Exclude specific metrics with <code>collection.disabled-metrics</code>.</li>
        <li>Delete a player's data with <code>/statfyr purge &lt;player&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li>Only information required for server analytics is stored.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All collection, storage and aggregation runs off the main thread.</li>
        <li>Snapshots are batched on an interval — never per event.</li>
        <li>Time-series reads stream files and filter by time; profiles are small and cached.</li>
        <li>Folia's regionised scheduler is used automatically on Folia servers.</li>
