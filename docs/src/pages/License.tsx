          <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache License, Version 2.0</a>{" "}
          with one extra term, the{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/PotenFYR-Studios/statfyr/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commons Clause</a>.
          The combination is called "Apache-2.0 with Commons Clause", and this page explains what
          it means in plain terms.

        <h2>What you can do</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Use it for anything.</strong> Personal servers, networks, commercial servers:
            statfyr is free for any purpose, including commercial use.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fork and modify it.</strong> Change the code, fix bugs, add features; your
            changes are yours.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Self-host it.</strong> Run it on as many servers as you like. No license keys,
            no seat limits, no phone-home.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Redistribute it.</strong> Share original or modified copies, as long as the
            license notices stay attached.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Build on top of it.</strong> Dashboards, Discord bots, server panels, stat
            sites: tools built on statfyr's API can be free or paid, and they are yours to shape.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What you can't do</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Sell statfyr itself.</strong> The Commons Clause forbids selling the plugin,
            or offering a paid product or service whose value comes entirely or substantially from
            statfyr's functionality, without a separate agreement with PotenFYR Studios.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use our names and marks.</strong> "Statfyr", "PotenFYR", and the studio's
            logos may not brand or promote a derivative product without permission.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Attribution requirement</h2>
        <p>
          Every copy or redistribution, original or modified, must carry the license notices: the
          Apache-2.0 text plus the Commons Clause notice. Keep the <code>LICENSE</code> file
          intact and your project complies.
        </p>

        <h2>The fine print</h2>
        <p>
          This page is a plain-terms summary, not the license. The authoritative text is the{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/PotenFYR-Studios/statfyr/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LICENSE file in the repository</a>;
          if this page and that file ever disagree, the file wins. Questions? The{" "}
          <Link to="/about">about page</Link> lists how to reach us.
